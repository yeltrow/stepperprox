stepperprox.comp is a component for linuxcnc.  
 
It provides homing accuracy improvements (0.00015" on my mill).
It provides a way of guarding against skipped step induced tragedy.

It is released as free softwae with no warranties of any kind.

The needed hardware is a target and a proximity sensor.  
A setscrew into the side of the leadscrew will work for the target.
Any industrial prox with adquate noise rejection will work. 24V is good.
